     <H1>Hi, IÂ´m Jess!</H1>

     <Text>
      I have a passion for design, creation and technology. I made my first
      website when I was just 13 years old, influenced by my father who was a
      developer. Since then I never stopped. What started as a hobby turned into
      my professional journey.
      <p>
       Over the years I also worked as a designer, which brought me fundamental
       knowledge about creation and UX and UI. I also specialize in design
       thinking and agile development methodologies, which match my
       entrepreneurial profile, passionate about organization and productivity.
       Today I work as a front-end developer and I seek to deliver optimized
       solutions, in clean and functional projects.
