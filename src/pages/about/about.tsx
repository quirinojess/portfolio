    <H1>Hi, IÂ´m Jess!</H1>

    <Text>
     I have a passion for design, creation and technology. I made my first
     website when I was just 13 years old, influenced by my father who was a
     developer. Since then I never stopped. What started as a hobby turned into
     my professional journey.
     <p>
      Over the years I also worked as a designer, which brought me fundamental
      knowledge about creation and UX and UI. I also specialize in design
      thinking and agile development methodologies, which match my
      entrepreneurial profile, passionate about organization and productivity.
      Today I work as a front-end developer and I seek to deliver optimized
      solutions, in clean and functional projects.
