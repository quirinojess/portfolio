  text:
   "<P>I Have more than 7 years of experience in the area of web development. My interest starts when i was teenager and my father was programmer, he taught me a little <strong><i>Java</i></strong> which possibly explains why I went into the front end area. Jokes aside, I've always liked drawing things and designing visual interfaces was something that naturally happened to me. Having worked as a designer and in marketing for many years, I added this knowledge to my career as a developer, standing out as a professional with specialization in SEO, user experience, performance and best practices in product development. </P><p>  Personally, I consider myself a very creative and inquisitive person. I have a good aesthetic sense and I am quite organized. I always seek to demonstrate these best virtues in the development of everything I do, always seeking to deliver the best and solve problems that I encounter on my way.</p>",
